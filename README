Introduction

KVIrc Log Archiver is Software developed originally for personal use, I decided to
upload it to github to allow other KVIrc users to sort their logging files more
logically as well.

-a <directory> = Specify location of the archives, if the folder has spaces in the name DOUBLE quotes are required.
